# January Learnings: meandering blockchain beginner

Over the past 4 weeks, I've been reading about Bitcoin and the blockchain that it relies on for the distributed ledger that makes the magic happen.

I have a [not-so-secret](https://twitter.com/davehoover/status/692505500399828996) ambition to start working on something in the blockchain space at some point this year.

It's certainly a dramatic space these days, with [the departure of Mike Hearn](https://medium.com/@octskyward/the-resolution-of-the-bitcoin-experiment-dabb30201f7) and many people agreeing with his assessment that the Bitcoin experiment is finished.

I'm more optimistic, mostly out of ignorance, but also because my buddy [Brian Forde](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/bforde) seems optimistic. I'm also starting now, fresh, without any baggage, so if it takes some more years for the ecosystem to hit a tipping point, I'm ready to wait. I imagine that the people who've been involved over the past few years are pretty burned out.

The idealist in me is drawn to Bitcoin for similar reasons that many people (including me) were drawn to the Internet 20 years ago: decentralization. I've learned that few things get me more excited than participating in the process of decentralizing human-centered systems, such as [decentralizing education](http://nuts.redsquirrel.com/post/5597859974/for-a-purpose-but-also).

Bitcoin's success is directly tied to its ability to remain decentralized. As I've been reading about the happenings of the Bitcoin Core development team, it's apparent that they are incredibly mindful of any changes that would have centralizing effects on the miner community.

Assuming I keep learning about Bitcoin, I will talk more about why I'm attracted to decentralization. For now, I'll leave off with a brief list of the resources I've used to help me learn this month:

* I bought a [21](http://21.co) computer. They have [some great tutorials](https://21.co/learn/) and a very supportive Slack channel. (Shout out to [Will Binns](https://twitter.com/21binns)!) I dug around in their Python code to try to understand how they do what they do. That didn't help much, but conceptually, I think I "get" 21.
* I've been reading a lot, here are some of the highlights:
  * [The original white paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)
  * A paper on [Pegged Sidechains](https://blockstream.com/sidechains.pdf)
  * [Ethereum's Future](https://medium.com/@ConsenSys/programmable-blockchains-in-context-ethereum-s-future-cd8451eb421e)
  * Some high-level papers from Deloitte: [Fact, Fiction, Future](http://d2mtr37y39tpbu.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/DUP_847_BitcoinFactFictionFuture.pdf) and [State-Sponsored Cryptocurrency](http://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/strategy/us-cons-state-sponsored-cryptocurrency.pdf)
  * [Colored Coins](https://github.com/Colored-Coins/Colored-Coins-Protocol-Specification/wiki)

A big thanks to Brian Forde for providing me with an awesome set of resources to seed my studies!
