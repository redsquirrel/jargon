# My first post in a long time

I helped build [Jargon](http://jargon.io) during the 2015 Rails Rumble competition. So now I'm feeling compelled to start blogging again. (My most recent blogging was happening at [Red Squirrel's Nuts](http://nuts.redsquirrel.com/).) I'll be updating this post soon with some more thoughts.

**Update**: I've started a lot of different work streams lately, and I think it's time to pare down. I'll share more openly about this soon. My priorities are:

* Spend a significant chunk of every week developing software.
* Spend 5 of 7 days per week at home.
* No full-time jobs.
* Stay with [Dev Bootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com) long-term.

**Update**: [Mike](https://twitter.com/mikelikesbikes) asked a [clarifying question](https://twitter.com/mikelikesbikes/status/663805691811921920) about my priorities.
