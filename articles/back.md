# Back to my roots

I've been blogging for over 13 years. Here's [my first post](http://www.redsquirrel.com/blog/archives/00000004.html) from 2002. I'm thinking about that post and that year for a couple reasons: 1) I helped develop [jargon.io](http://jargon.io) last weekend, 2) I'm actively developing software again. I had been writing less and less code over the past five years as I took on some leadership roles at Obtiva, Groupon, and Dev Bootcamp. Now I'm taking a step back and reconfiguring my worklife.

My Github page tells part of the story of this year:

I dove back into developing software in early August. It was daunting and a bit scary. Impostor syndrome reared its ugly head a few times, especially when I took on a project to develop an [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) for a startup. Now, after a few months under my belt, I'm feeling great, and I'm hungry for more.

In 2002, I was starting to poke my head up into the wider software development community after a couple years of self-study and pet projects. I connected with the community through the written word then, I'm ready to take that same approach again. And I plan to start blogging in the same style that I blogged back in the day.

I'll share code snippets. I'll share my thoughts. I'll pose questions.

I won't be writing well-formed essays or articles. I'm getting back to my roots, and that means blogging the same way I did back in 2002.

By the way, here's my favorite little quirky code from today:

```ruby
today = Date.current
# Last Monday (or today)
today -= 1 while today.wday != 1
```
