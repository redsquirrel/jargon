# April Learnings: be the worst

Almost exactly 12 years ago, I decided to leave a job with relative safety and seniority in order to [Be the Worst](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/ch04.html) at ThoughtWorks. That decision radically changed my life, mainly for the better. A bit older, and hopefully wiser, I've decided to repeat this pattern. I'm joining [ConsenSys](https://consensys.net/), a blockchain app production studio, focused on [Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper). I have a good feeling about ConsenSys, though my eyes are wide open about the pros/cons of operating within a fast-growing, decentralized organization.

## Choosing Ethereum over Bitcoin

For as much as I love programming languages and solving technical problems, culture is my top priority when choosing where to focus my time. From what I can tell, the Bitcoin culture is __toxic__. There are many incredible people involed in the community, including the people who have been so instrumental to and encouraging of my progress into this field: [Brian Forde](https://twitter.com/brianforde), [Neha Narula](https://twitter.com/neha), and [Elizabeth Stark](https://twitter.com/starkness). Despite the contributions of many brilliant and wonderful people, the general culture of Bitcoin feels paranoid and deadlocked. And yet, Bitcoin is an incredible technology and I had been willing to put up with its culture... until I found an alternative. I do believe Bitcoin will survive its troubles and even outlive me, but I don't think it will thrive in the same way that [Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper) will.

Ethereum has countless advantages over Bitcoin, mainly from learning from its predecessor, as well as the mountain of academic cryptocurrency research that has built up since Bitcoin's invention in 2009. I won't even begin to catalog the superior architectural decisions that have already been incorporated into Ethereum that will take years to (or never) happen for Bitcoin. These are very important, but like I said, culture is my priority.

Ethereum has a known, effective leader. [Vitalik Buterin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin) is an amazing person, and from what I can tell is doing a fine job of leading the community. Simply knowing who the Ethereum creator is, and hearing from him consistently, sets a significantly different tone than Bitcoin, where the leader was anonymous, and is now absent. Vitalik and the Ethereum Foundation's development team have certainly made mistakes, and will continue to, but that leads me to the other aspect of the Ethereum culture that I'm attracted to: they embrace change.

As a long-time agile software developer, I adhere to the principle of "if it hurts, do it all the time". This principle led to practices such as continuous integration, continuous deployment, merciless refactoring, and test-driven development. A culture that leans into the pain/fear of progress has produced blocks every 15 seconds (40x more frequent than Bitcoin) and a non-drama-filled [hard fork](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2.mediawiki). I believe that Ethereum's culture is well-positioned to overcome their mistakes, whereas Bitcoin's culture appears to be relatively paralyzed by theirs.

I'm also heartened by Ethereum protocol proposals like [this one](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-6.md):

> ...change the name of the SUICIDE opcode in Ethereum programming languages with SELFDESTRUCT...
> The primary reason for us to change the term suicide is to show that people matter more than code and Ethereum is a mature enough of a project to recognize the need for a change.

It's also nice to have [Vinay Gupta](https://twitter.com/leashless) around writing stuff like [this](https://medium.com/@ConsenSys/programmable-blockchains-in-context-ethereum-s-future-cd8451eb421e) and giving talks like [this](https://vimeo.com/161183966).

My decision is certainly subjective, my experiences are quite limited, and Ethereum could certainly end up in a toxic place in the coming years, but I'm going to do everything I can to prevent that.
