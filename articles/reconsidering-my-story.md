# Reconsidering: My story

It was startling for me to see [David Heinemeier Hansson](http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/) quote the Bible in his recent blog post titled [RECONSIDER](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3972-reconsider). He attempted to paint "the San Franciscan economic model" as a religion, with references to "[angel investors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_investor)", Mecca (SF), and liquidity events (baptism).

I appreciate David's aggressive approach. The "Get Big or GTFO" unicorn-hunting mindset is so pervasive in startup culture that people have stopped questioning it. Some even faithfully evangelize the message. Loudly. The reason David's post stands out is because "...people building profitable companies outside the sphere of the VC dominion have little systemic need to tell their story." Despite having little incentive to tell his story, he took the time to do it.

Inspired by RECONSIDER, I'm going to tell some of my story.

## Getting good

I'm a self-taught software developer, so the first 5 years of my career were spent in [a self-constructed, self-directed apprenticeship](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/index.html). These years were capped off by a two year stint at ThoughtWorks, where I got to "be the worst guy in the band" for a while, and learned from some excellent software developers.

I left ThoughtWorks in 2006 with a lot of other good software developers who wanted to transition from writing Java code for Fortune 500 companies to writing Ruby code for startups. I joined Obtiva, a 3-person Java-focused consultancy in Wheaton, Illionis, and within a year, I landed us a full-time Ruby on Rails gig ([Mad Mimi](http://madmimi.com)) for me to work on.

## Organic, linear growth

From 2006-2011, I helped grow both Obtiva and Mad Mimi.

Obtiva was a bootstrapped and profitable custom software consultancy, a "dev shop", a bunch of software developers who companies paid to deliver software. We grew our business by writing great software and apprenticing people into great software developers.

Mad Mimi was founded by a guy who had a bit of angel funding, and he spent most of that money on getting his software system built by me and a few other contractors. Once the system was released to the public, Mad Mimi gradually became profitable. They grew organically through astoundingly good customer service, and were never in a position where they needed additional capital to grow.

Neither Obtiva or Mad Mimi were disruptive. They simply provided value to customers. On many days, we actually delighted customers. Obtiva wasn't trying to "scale" and overtake ThoughtWorks or Accenture. Mad Mimi wasn't trying to keep up with Mailchimp's ascendence or put Constant Contact out of business. These founders stuck to their values, and grew profitable companies organically for years. There were no hockey-stick moments of market domination, just a long series of small wins that added up over the years into significant revenue streams.

From 2012-2015, I helped grow Dev Bootcamp, yet another bootstrapped business. This time, though, the business was disruptive, and within a couple years, it inspired [an entirely new little industry](https://www.coursereport.com/resources/course-report-2015-bootcamp-market-size-study). Despite the enormous opportunity (and temptation) to go for a land-grab in 2012, we decided to grow the business organically. It was more important to us to maintain the integrity of our (imperfect yet) powerful learning culture than attempt to dominate the market that we had helped create. So we added Chicago in 2013, NYC in 2014, and we're adding San Diego in early 2016. This is steady, organic growth.

## Funded, exponential growth

In 2007, right as I was in the thick of building Mad Mimi, Obtiva was contacted by thepoint.com for some Ruby help. We didn't have the bandwidth to help them, and disappointingly, didn't get involved. In mid-2009, we heard back from the same people, only now they were calling themselves Groupon. We got involved, and I started spending some of my time consulting with their team. There was also a steadily increasingly number of Obtivians engaging with them full-time. Over my first couple weeks there, I was introduced to their incredibly quirky culture. Chicago's improv community had infiltrated Groupon's editorial team, and Groupon's young CEO, Andrew Mason, successfully took up the challenge of being [an utterly quirky CEO](https://twitter.com/andrewmason/status/1432192088).

Spending time at Groupon was exciting for me. They were a different sort of startup than anything I'd seen before. They had funding, they were expanding *rapidly*, they had unique technical scaling challenges to solve, and they were in the news. The idea of a big famous tech company growing up in Chicago stoked my competitive nature. When the Google acquisition rumors started swirling in 2010, it felt like we had arrived.

And yet, in the lead-up to their IPO in 2011, the company lost its soul. I watched Andrew's external persona and internal style gradually become less authentic, and far more serious and conservative. For a company that wanted to IPO, that was the right thing to do. But it also opened my eyes to the inevitable price that a company pays when they take VC money. To be clear, when Obtiva sold, we were hitching our wagon to that same VC-fueld train. I was certainly complicit in the whole thing, and "sold out" as much as anyone.

## Liquidity events

In 2011, Groupon bought Obtiva. In 2014, GoDaddy bought Mad Mimi, and Kaplan bought Dev Bootcamp. I owned minority chunks of equity in all of these companies, so I ended up with some cash. In early 2012, I started investing relatively small sums of money in Chicago startups. As David would say, I used these liquidity events to baptize myself into the fellowship of angel investors.

## Angel investing

From 2012-2015, I invested in 13 different startups, and even successfully [syndicated](https://angel.co/davehoover/syndicate) a deal through AngelList. I have learned and continue to learn directly and indirectly from the founders I've invested in. I have also connected with many different angel investors and venture capitalists in Chicago and Silicon Valley, and gradually learned some of their convential wisdoms. I say "wisdoms" here because, as you might expect, the wisdom of the Silicon Valley VC is different from the Chicago VC.

From a VC perspective, "the San Franciscan economic model" can be summed up as the unicorn hunt. Herd as many different high-potential little critters onto your game reserve, check in on the critters over 5-10 years, and hopefully one little critter will emerge as a unicorn. This unicorn will generate an enormous amount of wealth for many people, including the VC, and will allow them to build a bigger game reserve for the next hunt. This incredible cycle has repeated itself so many times over the past 40 years that the SV VC convential wisdom has leaked out and influenced the convential wisdoms of VCs big and small, as well as angel investors, regardless of where they operate. I'll write more about this in my next post, but like David, I think many people need to wake up and reject a "conventional wisdom" that just doesn't apply to us.

From a VC perspective, "the Chicago way" is, as you might expect, a lot more conservative. Not m(any) modern unicorns have emerged from the Chicago startup ecosystem, and so there are fewer audacious startups to invest in. Even if there were more aspiring unicorns here, not many of our VCs or angels have experience investing in them. The pattern matching that investors invariably use to take educated guesses on which startup will succeed is not well-tuned for unicorn hunting in Chicago.

Thankfully, what I've found is that in Chicago, you can balance your startup investments along the spectrum that David described as: 

> A 30% chance of making $3M is as good as a 3% chance of making $30M is as good as a 0.3% chance at making $300M.

I have investments that are trying to achieve exponential growth. I have investments that are growing linearly. Some have a low risk of failure, some are high risk.

Investor friends in SF have told me that I'm doing it wrong. They've told me:

* I haven't invested in enough companies. It should be 30, not 13.
* I shouldn't invest in companies that aren't aspiring unicorns.

They might be right. And for a while I was sure they were right. But these days I'm not so sure. I do have a few strengths as a startup investor:

* I know (intimately) how successful tech entrepreneurs operate. I can pattern match using my experiences at Obtiva, Mad Mimi, Groupon, and Dev Bootcamp.
* I am good at reading people and interpersonal dynamics. Before I learned how to build software systems, I studied psychology for 6 years, and was a practicing family therapist.
* 12 of my 13 startups are still going strong!
* The other one [got acquired](http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20150820/BLOGS11/150819779/raise-com-buys-tastebud-doubles-staff) this year!

## That was long

If you're still reading, I hope you learned something along the way. I learn from writing, so at least it helped me!

My next "Reconsidering" post will be about why I have no interest in taking investments in any of my future business ventures.
