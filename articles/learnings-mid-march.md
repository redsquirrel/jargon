# Mid-March Learnings: tipping point

As I wrap up the excellent [Mastering Bitcoin](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032281.do), I'm feeling a lot less confused, and even relatively knowledgable about Bitcoin. Since my last update, I've successfully stored [some arbitrary data on the blockchain](https://blockchain.info/tx/a5f7a7fc760f159411e9797321a7c9842d964c218dd2f5261d4c5bd59ce705c3) via my Ruby scripts, using [OP_RETURN](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/OP_RETURN). I started working on an EventMachine/bitcoin-ruby-inspired Rubygem called [EM-Bitcoin](https://github.com/redsquirrel/em-bitcoin), but then put it on hold to focus on something more practical. This week, I've built a proof-of-concept notary service in Rails that has successfully posted the digital fingerprints of uploaded PDF documents to the blockchain. I'm going to keep building this out and see what happens when I launch it publicly. It has been a great learning experience.

I've also been focusing more on [Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper) after attending the [Chicago Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Chicago-Ethereum-Meetup/events/229318593/). In a lot of ways, Ethereum feels like Bitcoin 2.0. They have advantage of hindsight, and learning from their older sibling's mistakes. Also the fact that Ethereum's programming language is Turing-complete is scary/exciting.

I've started expressing interest in jobs in the cryptocurrency space. It has been promising so far. I imagine my next update will include some news about a new gig.
