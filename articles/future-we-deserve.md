# Quotes from The Future We Deserve

[Vinay Gupta](https://twitter.com/leashless) works at [ConsenSys](https://consensys.net/), where I've been contracting since April. He is one of the more intriguing and thought-provoking people I've ever been exposed to. To be clear, we work at the same company, but our paths cross very rarely, so I mainly know him through his writing (public blogging &amp; twitter, and private Slack) and his speaking (like [this](https://vimeo.com/161183966)). I've been offended, confused, but mostly inspired by him

I read [Mirrorshades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirrorshades) at his recommendation. And now I've just finished [The Future We Deserve](http://thefuturewedeserve.com/), which is 100 essays edited by Vinay and friends. I'm using the rest of this blog post as a quote dump from this book.

We inhabit -- or would if we stopped looking past it -- a wonderous unfolding present. We are, or can train ourselves to be, witnesses to that unfolding. The discipline and humility required to inhabit our present, to live within a gift, is in itself a corrective that might lead us to a future we cannot predict. If we fail to inhabit our present we lose the only thing we know we have. Unless we turn our meditation on the future into motivation to focus on the present, we give up a "sure-thing" to remain within a chimera, a fantasy of heaven or hell, imagined brightly or darkly, arrived at actively or passively but assuredly nowhere.

Therefore to give our advances in stuff the absolute best chance of delivering the change we need, we need to develop our minds in lockstep. [Rohan Gunatillake](http://www.appropedia.org/This_is_Mental._-_Rohan_Gunatillake)

The [Leading Causes of Life](http://www.abingdonpress.com/product/9780687655335#.V5TdjZOAOko) provides a framework within which we can understand better the things which enhance our lives, but that economic metrics fail to encapsulate. A future worth deserving must contain more than apocolypse dodging... Witout living in awe of nature we risk teetering from one existential crisis to another, cowering behind the brute force protection of technology. [Chris Malins](http://www.appropedia.org/6_Ways_to_Live_-_Chris_Malins)

...the deepest and most profound experience available to us ... is not something to cling to ... but something to learn from. ... To engage with the unfolding of deeper and more profound experience is to open the door to learning the most profound lessons of all. ... We each share the possibility of deep and profound experience; but how many of us are willing to understand it as best we can and learn from it? [Alan Chapman](http://www.appropedia.org/Deep_Lessons_-_Alan_Chapman)

Our biggest challenge is how to tame ourselves. The threats we face today are of a different kind. They come from the over-exploitation of our environment, exploitation of one another, and the damage we wreak in the thrall to our egos because we do not accept the meaning of the word "enough". ... The sustenance and growth of the future now depend on the forces of equilibrium, harmony, and biological and cultural diversity, as we begin to evolve into maturity as a sentient species and organize across boundaries in [better] ways. [Anne McCrossan](http://www.appropedia.org/Semantic_Organization_and_Connectivity_-_Anne_McCrossan)

...highlighting the greatest ethic of education, that imparting education is a selfless contribution of the past generation to the present, and the present generation to the future. [Anil Prasad](http://www.appropedia.org/Online_Open_Distance_Learning_-_Anil_Prasad)

When it becomes unthinkable to let our neighbors step in our dogs' shit; when we finally accept that we are our brothers' keepers; then we will deserve the future we want and we'll find we already know how to get it. We don't need a technological revolution. What we need is a moral revolution. [Eldan Goldenberg](http://www.appropedia.org/Deserving_The_Future_We_Want_-_Eldan_Goldenberg)

Only the most radical of employers, willing to become fools to the logic of capitalism, can tolerate that which makes work more enjoyable while also less productive. ... Unlike Silicon Valley, though, these hackers have given up on the goal of getting rich. They are driven by the desire to make spaces in which they want to spend time, sociable spaces of living, working and playing, as they -- and the rest of us -- adjust to the likelihood of getting poorer. [Dougald Hine](http://www.appropedia.org/The_Spaces_We_Deserve_-_Dougald_Hine)

Education should be a challenge, with the acceptance that we might fail. In fact there is something wrong if someone does not fail. ... When people find the challenge that grips them they are inspired. They become activated to learn for themselves.

"The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes but in having new eyes." Marcel Proust (quoted by [Kenneth Lo](http://www.appropedia.org/The_Future_is_Here_-_Kenneth_Lo))
