# Reconsidering: Cakes

[David Heinemeier Hansson](http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/)'s recent post [RECONSIDER](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3972-reconsider) has been bouncing around in my head since the day it was published. I'm going to try to blog few times this week about it, since I'm in [short-and-unstructured blogging mode](http://jargon.io/redsquirrel/back) these days.

First, this post is classic David. I admire his ability to make a strong point and really hammer it home through language, art, and taking an extreme stance. I admire this because I struggle with that approach, and because he and I tend to agree, and because his approach has worked amazingly well over the past decade.

Second, I won't call him DHH because those are my initials and my ego won't allow it. :)

Third, RECONSIDER is well-aligned with my [Eating Million Dollar Cakes](http://nuts.redsquirrel.com/post/17368003887/eating-million-dollar-cakes) post from a few years back. In that post, I was trying to re-appropriate the word "startup" and re-cast "startup life" as something that didn't require the VC-inspired unicorn hunt. I pointed out some examples of men I knew who had grown healthy multi-million-dollar businesses while maintaining their husband-hood and fatherhood.

Lastly (at least for today), the whole point of "million dollar cakes" was to point out something that David stated so clearly:

> A 30% chance of making $3M is as good as a 3% chance of making $30M is as good as a 0.3% chance at making $300M.

When you take that moonshot at $300M please understand that you're playing the venture capitalist's game, you're inevitably going to inherit the venture capitalist's values, what David refers to as "the San Franciscan economic model".

Why not play by your own rules, live your own life, and take a less audacious shot at $3M? (WHICH IS A TON OF MONEY!)

My next "Reconsidering" post will be about angel investing. (Hint: [I'm an angel investor.](https://angel.co/davehoover))
