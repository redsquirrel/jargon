# Reconsidering: The future

This is my final [RECONSIDER](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3972-reconsider)-inspired post. [Here are all of them.](http://jargon.io/site/tags/reconsider)

I spent a lot of 2015 considering how I would spend my time in 2016. I was honestly all over the place. I considered:

* Taking the year off
* Starting a tech-focused seed fund
* Starting a venture-building studio
* Starting a dev shop

None of this ended up fitting for me because I found myself actively developing software again in August. Being a maker again has brought me [back to my roots](back). For now, I'm simply content to get paid to keep making stuff. I'm not interested in taking a year off, or starting a fund, or hiring people into a studio or shop. I'm back to solving interesting technical problems every day, and that's enough. For now, I'll simply be freelancing.

I predict that within a year or so, I will be ready to commit to some new endeavor, and I can tell you now what I'll be looking for then.

## No exit strategy

After pouring a lot of my heart and soul into Obtiva and Dev Bootcamp, I have no interest in experiencing another acquisition. Either I need to stop putting my heart and soul into my work, or I need to work passionately on something that's dedicated to remaining independent forever. If you know me at all, you'll know that my only option is the latter.

## Clear mission

Over the past 11 years, I've worked at ThoughtWorks, Obtiva, and Dev Bootcamp. All of these companies were/are able to articulate a mission that they are attempting to accomplish. I love a clear mission, or even better, a clear series of missions. [The Apollo program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program) must be one of the most famous examples of clear, incremental missions.

My mission-orientation was shaped by my experiences playing (D3) college football. The Wheaton College football program had never won our conference before. In each of my first three seasons we came very close, but always just missed. My teammates and I worked extremely hard to make ourselves better football players in order to give our team a better shot at achieving our mission. Finally, in my senior year, we did it. We went undefeated and won the conference championship.

Between my professional experiences and athletic experiences, I'm intolerant of working in organizations that lack a clear mission.

## Remote and asynchronous

For years, my professional motto was "latent human potential pisses me off". This line of thinking drew me out of software development and into developing software developers at Dev Bootcamp. Nowadays, that motto has become much more personal.

As my mode of work has shifted from "8am-5pm in Chicago" to "two days a week in Chicago", I've found myself far more invested in the potential of my wife and three children. It clear to me that the next few years are a critical season of growth for all four of them.

Therefore, I will continue working remotely. I am not willing to sacrifice my time and focus on them at this point. I need to be able to work asynchronously in order to ensure I can prioritize:

* Doing chores around the house
* Helping with homework and studying
* Attending school events
* Meeting with teachers and coaches
* Visiting colleges

## PS: I am not making any future angel investments.

This is pretty simple. I'm saving my remaining capital to give me and my family more freedom in the future.

Will there be moments of [FoMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out)? Yep. And will I *actually* miss out on some stuff that would have paid off? Probably. Would that payoff benefit my family? Yep.

But I think my family will benefit more from directly investing *in them*.
